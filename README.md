# Introduction 
[Sourcd](http://#) allows a user to discover more about unfamiliar ingredients from the back of a label. 

Anonymous users can upload a picture that will be parsed for text.  From the list, the user can choose one 
word.  Sourcd will display information about the word like its common name, what product it's commonly found 
in, and if it's suitable for particular diets.

Registered users, in addition to uploading a picture, can look for words they have previously searched.
